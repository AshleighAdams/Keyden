# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the Keyden app (hereby referred to as "Application") that was created by Ashleigh Adams (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Open Source service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

**What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?**

Limited information is collected and stored locally on your device, including settings which may include machine names linked to your password manager's account, public SSH keys, and SSH key names.

No other information is obtained. No information is submitted to the Service Provider. Registration is not required to use the Application. 

**Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?**

This Application does not collect precise information about the location of your device.

**Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?**

The aforementioned limited information may be shared with the configured backend password manager. Please refer to your password manager's privacy policy.

No additional data is shared with third parties.

**What are my opt-out rights?**

You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your device or via the device's application marketplace or network.

**Children**

The Application is not used to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.

The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. The Service Provider encourages all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. The Service Provider encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to the Service Provider through the Application and/or Services, please contact the Service Provider (support+keyden@ashleigh.dev) so that they will be able to take the necessary actions. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).

**Security**

The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. However, since the Service Provider does not obtain any information, there is no risk of your data being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

**Changes**

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to their Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.
